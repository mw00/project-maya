// src/ds4/ds4_model.hpp - DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on Maya: an EXL3 model (tools/ds4/pack.py's pack beside its files) over
// the machine's GPUs, layer-split, with the routed experts that do not fit in VRAM on the CPU lane.
//
// Windows of up to 16 tokens through every layer (a prompt in windows, a decode step a window of one): each query of a
// window sees exactly what the reference's decode path gives it (DeepSeek's inference/model.py at start_pos > 0) -
// its own 128-token window, the compressed groups completed by its position.  The state a token leaves is the
// 128-token window ring of every layer, the compressors' partial groups, the compressed KV and index keys of the KV
// source layers (append-only), and the Engram n-gram history; checkpoint() / restore() keep the first two (the rest is
// truncated by position) so a conversation can go back to the end of its last prompt.

// src/kernels/cuda/sampler.cu - P2.S2: the sampler chain, in llama.cpp's order.
//
//     penalties -> top_k -> top_p -> min_p -> temperature -> pick
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE CONTENT OF THIS FILE.  llama.cpp builds its chain by walking `params.samplers`, whose
// default is { PENALTIES, DRY, TOP_N_SIGMA, TOP_K, TYPICAL_P, TOP_P, MIN_P, XTC, TEMPERATURE } (`common/common.h`
// at 3cf03257) - ONE penalties stage, first, and TEMPERATURE AFTER THE TRUNCATION FILTERS.  (Issue #53: this file
// used to apply the penalties a second time after the temperature, and min_p before top_p - both taken from the
// order of the `case` labels in `common/sampling.cpp`, which is not the order the chain runs.)  Every order
// produces a valid token, so only a comparison at the distribution level can tell them apart; the parity test
// does that against an independently computed distribution.
//
// Both kernels put ONE BLOCK per token over the vocabulary: `sampler_greedy_kernel` is the plain argmax,
// `sampler_kernel` runs the sampled chain as `top_k` block-argmax rounds followed by the top_p / temperature /
// draw chain (its header says why the selection must be parallel and why the tie rule keeps the semantics).

/// with 64 threads and a `if (t >= n_tokens) return;` at the top.  The decode path has `n_tokens == 1`, so
/// that launch was `<<<1, 64>>>`, 63 threads exited on the first line, and ONE THREAD walked all 248,320
/// logits in a dependent loop on one SM of 48.  Measured in isolation (`bench/micro/sampler_cost.cu`):
/// **3.11 ms per token**, 5.7% of an ~54 ms token, and the whole of round 309's `sample` phase - the two
/// synchronisations around it are 0.03 ms each.
///
/// The obvious repair is to parallelise the scan inside `sampler_kernel`, and it is WRONG: with one thread
/// per token, a block reduction over the vocabulary has nothing to reduce, and the threads that returned
/// early are not there for `__syncthreads` or `__shfl_down_sync`.  The first attempt did exactly that and
/// produced the token `5120` thirty-two times.  The grid has to be over tokens with the BLOCK over the
/// vocabulary, which is a different launch configuration and therefore a different kernel.
///
/// **THE TIE RULE IS UNCHANGED AND THAT IS THE WHOLE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT.**  The serial scan walked `v`
/// ascending with `if (s > bv)`, so the LOWEST index wins a tie.  Each thread keeps that rule over its own
/// strided subset and the reduction resolves two candidates by taking the larger value and, on equality, the
/// SMALLER index - the same total order, so `sampler_parity` and C1 see no change.
